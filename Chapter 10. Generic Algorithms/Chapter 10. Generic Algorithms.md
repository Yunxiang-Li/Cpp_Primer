# Chapter 10. Generic Algorithms

## Exercise 10.1

**The algorithm header defines a function named count that, like find, takes a pair of iterators and a value. count returns a count of how often that value appears. Read a sequence of ints into a vector and print the count of how many elements have a given value.**
