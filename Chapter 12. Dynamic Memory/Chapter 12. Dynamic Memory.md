# Chapter 12. Dynamic Memory


## Exercise 12.1

**How many elements do b1 and b2 have at the end of this code?**

```cpp
StrBlob b1;
{    
  StrBlob b2 = {"a", "an", "the"};
  b1 = b2;
  b2.push_back("about");
}
```

Because of the `shared_ptr`, both `b1` and `b2` will have 4 elements at the end of this code even after `b2` is out of scope.

## Exercise 12.2

**Write your own version of the StrBlob class including the const versions of front and back.**
