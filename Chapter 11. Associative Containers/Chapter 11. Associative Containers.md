# Chapter 11. Associative Containers

## Exercise 11.1

**Describe the differences between a map and a vector.**

A `map` is a associative container of key-value pairs. Each value is binded to a key thus we can get a value by its key.

A `vector` is a sequential container of objects and every object has an associated index thus we can access to each object by its index.

## Exercise 9.5

**Rewrite the previous program to return an iterator to the requested element. Note that the program must handle the case where the element is not found.**
